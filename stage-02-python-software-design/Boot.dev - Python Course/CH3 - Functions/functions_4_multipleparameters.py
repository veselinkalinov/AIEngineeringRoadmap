Assignment

We need to calculate the total damage from a combo of three attacks.

Complete the triple_attack function by returning the sum of its parameters, damage_one, damage_two, and damage_three. Remember to indent the code inside the function.

def triple_attack(damage_one, damage_two, damage_three):
    damage_sum = damage_one + damage_two + damage_three
    return damage_sum


# This is the first triple attack
attack_one = 2
attack_two = 4
attack_three = 3
first_triple_attack_damage = triple_attack(
    attack_one, attack_two, attack_three)

print("Getting damage for", attack_one, attack_two, "and", attack_three, "...")
print(first_triple_attack_damage, "points of damage dealt!")
print("=====================================")

# This is the second triple attack
attack_four = -1
attack_five = 10
attack_six = 5
second_triple_attack_damage = triple_attack(
    attack_four, attack_five, attack_six)

print("Getting damage for", attack_four, attack_five, "and", attack_six, "...")
print(second_triple_attack_damage, "points of damage dealt!")
print("=====================================")
