Assignment

Complete the become_warrior function. It accepts 2 inputs:

    The full_name string
    The power integer

It should return 2 values:

    A title string
    A new_power integer.

    Create the title using f-strings. Combine full_name with "the warrior" in this format:

    full_name the warrior

    Be very careful with the output of your program. The text will need to match the expected results exactly. Double-check your spacing and spelling!
    Create the new_power value that is equal to the input power + 1
    Return both title and new_power

Here's an example of how the function is intended to work:

title, power = become_warrior("Aang Airbender", 100)
print(title)
# "Aang Airbender the warrior"
print(power)
# 101
'''


def become_warrior(full_name: str, power: int):
    title = f"{full_name} the warrior"
    new_power = power + 1
    return title, new_power


def main():
    test("Frodo Baggins", 5)
    test("Bilbo Baggins", 10)
    test("Gandalf The Grey", 9000)


def test(input1, input2):
    result1, result2 = become_warrior(input1, input2)
    print(result1, "has a power level of:", result2)


main()
